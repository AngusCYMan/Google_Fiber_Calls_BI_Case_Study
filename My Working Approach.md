First, I started with completing 3 Key business intelligence documents under course guidence. 
The documents are:

1. Stakeholder Requirements Document
This is to capture stakeholder requests and requirements so you understand their needs before planning the rest of the project details or strategy.

2. Project Requirements Document
This document cover project requirements that need to be met to achieve the stakeholder requirements.

3. Strategy Document
This is a collaborative place to align with stakeholders about project deliverables.
